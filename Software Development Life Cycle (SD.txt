Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) – Step-by-Step
The SDLC is a structured process to develop high-quality software in a systematic, efficient, and predictable way.

1. Requirement Gathering & Analysis
Goal: Understand what the software should do.

Meet with stakeholders (clients, users, business teams).

Collect requirements through interviews, documents, or workshops.

Identify what features the system needs (functional) and how it should behave (non-functional).

Output: Requirement documents (BRD, SRS)

🛠 Developer's Role: Review requirements for clarity, ask questions, check technical feasibility.

2. Planning
Goal: Plan how to build the project.

Define project scope, timeline, cost, resources.

Decide on tools, tech stack (e.g., Java, Spring Boot, MySQL).

Risk analysis and mitigation planning.

🛠 Developer's Role: Estimate tasks, suggest frameworks/tools, plan sprints (if Agile).

3. Design
Goal: Create the blueprint for the application.

High-Level Design (HLD): System architecture, technologies, modules.

Low-Level Design (LLD): Class diagrams, database design, API contracts.

UI/UX design is also finalized.

🛠 Developer's Role: Design classes, REST APIs, select design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory).

4. Development (Implementation)
Goal: Build the actual application.

Start coding based on design.

Backend (Java code, business logic), frontend, database integration.

Follow coding standards and write unit tests.

🛠 Developer's Role: Write code, integrate modules, use tools like Git, Maven, JUnit.

5. Testing
Goal: Ensure the application is bug-free and meets requirements.

Types of testing:

Unit Testing

Integration Testing

System Testing

User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

Manual + Automated testing.

🛠 Developer's Role: Fix bugs found by QA, write test cases, support testing tools (Mockito, Selenium).

6. Deployment
Goal: Release the application to real users.

Deploy to staging first → then production.

Use CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes).

Monitor deployment success.

🛠 Developer's Role: Package app (JAR/WAR), configure environments, deploy and verify logs.

7. Maintenance & Support
Goal: Keep the application running smoothly post-release.

Fix bugs reported by users.

Add enhancements and new features.

Monitor performance, apply patches.

🛠 Developer's Role: Debug issues, optimize code, update libraries (e.g., Spring Boot versions).

🔄 Bonus: Agile/DevOps Approach
Agile: SDLC is done in cycles (sprints). You deliver features iteratively.

DevOps: Focuses on automation and collaboration between dev and ops teams for faster releases.
